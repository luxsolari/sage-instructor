"""
Checks whether the upstream three-axes-framework plugin's SKILL.md has
changed since references/philosophy.md was last adapted from it.

philosophy.md is NOT a copy of the upstream file -- it's a teaching-specific
adaptation (lesson-step calibration, curriculum-generation axis inference,
etc. that don't exist upstream). So this script never overwrites
philosophy.md automatically. It only diffs the upstream source against a
cached snapshot of the last-reviewed version, and tells you to go reconcile
by hand if something changed.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_framework_drift.py
        Fetch upstream, diff against the cached snapshot, print the result.
        Exits 1 if drift is found, 0 if clean (a network failure also exits
        1, with a message distinguishing it from real drift).

    python3 scripts/check_framework_drift.py --update-snapshot
        After manually reconciling philosophy.md against upstream changes,
        run this to accept the current upstream content as the new
        baseline snapshot.
